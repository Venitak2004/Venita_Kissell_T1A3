Pep 8 is the Python style guide for writing code I has a set of guidlines that help to improve readability and consistency. 
For example use 4 spaces when indeting, never use TABS.
Maximum line lengths of characters is 79 characters. 
When importing files they should be listed on separate lines and not combined on the same line. 
Imports have a heirarchy and should be imported in the following order standard libarary imports/related third-party imports/local appliation imports. 
The use of blank lines and space to make code easier to read.
However large amounts of white space is to be avoided. 
Comments should be complete sentences so it is easier for others to read your code better.
With naming conventions function names should be lowercase as are Variables, but Classes begin with a capital letter.
'Single Quotes' for small strings, and "Double Quotes" for strings that contain 'quotes'
'self' is always the first argument.

# Player Database
The Player Database is designed to be a simple tool for managing player information. It is designed to be easy to use and can be customised to suit clubs needs for the storage of player data.

## Features
The initial display has been spaced out for better aesthetics and readability, with simple but useful features. The user just needs to make a selection from the list of options.
 - Add a Player - will add a new player to the database and save their details in a csv file.
 - Update a Player - will update the exsting details already stored in the csv file, but will append the new data to the existing players data.
 - Full Player List - will give you every player listed in the entire database.
 - Search for a Specific Player - will prompt the user to input a players last name to search the system for a specific player, the system will return either one player or in the case of families, then multiple players, if the player is not in the database, the it will return an error message asking the user to check the spelling as player not found.
 - Generate a Team List - this will generate a team specific list for the user, they just need to put in the team name, for example U16FQ this will give the user an output of all the players listed in the database with U16FQ as the team they are allocated into, generating a full list of players for that team only.
 - Save - The save function will save changes made to player files.
 - Exit Without Saving - in the event the user has made a change and doesn't want to store it in the player file they can exit without saving.
